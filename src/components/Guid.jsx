                <h2>Understanding Waste: Dry vs. Wet Waste</h2>

                <h3>Dry Waste</h3>
                <div class="highlight">
                    <h4>What is Dry Waste?</h4>
                    <p>Dry waste consists of materials that do not decay and cannot be biodegraded. Examples include paper, glass, thermocol, Styrofoam, rubber, metal, cloth, empty bottles, and stationery. Dry waste can be recycled into new products. Sharp materials like glass and metals should be kept in a separate bag or container before disposal.</p>
                    
                    <h4>How to Dispose of Dry Waste</h4>
                    <p>Dry waste should be collected and sent for recycling. Proper disposal ensures it can be repurposed into new products and helps reduce environmental impact.</p>
                </div>
        
                <h3>Wet Waste</h3>
                <div class="highlight">
                    <h4>What is Wet Waste?</h4>
                    <p>Wet waste refers to kitchen waste, including vegetable peels, used tea bags, fruits, leftovers, coconut shells, flowers, leaves, meat or non-veg items, expired food, bread, biscuits, etc.</p>
                    
                    <h4>How to Dispose of Wet Waste</h4>
                    <p>Wet waste is organic and can be recycled and converted into compost. Efficient management systems are needed to handle wet waste effectively in kitchens, restaurants, buildings, and factories.</p>

                <h3>Why is Waste Segregation Necessary?</h3>
                <p>Segregating dry waste (like plastic, glass, metals, and paper) from wet waste makes it easier to recycle them into new products. Wet waste (such as vegetable leftovers and fruit scraps) can be used for producing compost and biogas. Proper waste management helps in reducing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Greenhouse gas emissions</li>
                    <li>Toxic gas explosions</li>
                    <li>Waste in landfills</li>
                    <li>Air, soil, and water pollution</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>Segregation of Waste at Home</h3>
                <p>Segregating waste at home can ease the burden on municipal authorities. Hereâ€™s how you can start:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep 2 separate dustbins for dry and wet waste.</li>
                    <li>Remove any covering on kitchen waste before throwing it in the dustbin.</li>
                    <li>Do not mix wet waste with dry waste.</li>
                    <li>Keep plastic from the kitchen dry and separate in the dry bin.</li>
                    <li>Rinse dry waste of any food content before placing it in the dry bin.</li>
                    <li>Throw sanitary waste in a separate paper bag.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>What is Waste Segregation?</h3>
                <p>Waste segregation is the process of separating different types of waste materials to facilitate recycling, composting, or proper disposal. This reduces landfill waste and promotes a sustainable environment.</p>
        
                <h3>Segregation at the Individual and Community Level</h3>
                <p>Segregation can be done individually, by separating recyclables from other trash at home, or at the community level through curbside programs. Many areas have curbside pickup programs for recycling and composting with separate bins provided for different waste types.</p>
        
                <h3>Benefits of Waste Segregation</h3>
                <p>Segregating waste helps in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reducing landfill waste</li>
                    <li>Conserving resources</li>
                    <li>Reducing greenhouse gas emissions</li>
                    <li>Making recycling and composting easier</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>Conclusion: Wet Garbage and Dry Garbage</h3>
                <p>Proper segregation of wet and dry waste is crucial for maintaining a pollution-free environment. Reusing and recycling these wastes, especially plastics, can lead to new products and plastic granules, promoting environmental health.</p>
